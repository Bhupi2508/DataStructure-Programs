## Need of Data Structures
As applications are getting complexed and amount of data is increasing day by day, there may arrise the following problems:

#### 1. Processor speed :- 
To handle very large amout of data, high speed processing is required, but as the data is growing day by day to the billions of files per entity, processor may fail to deal with that much amount of data.

#### 2. Data Search :- 
Consider an inventory size of 106 items in a store, If our application needs to search for a particular item, it needs to traverse 106 items every time, results in slowing down the search process.

#### 3. Multiple requests :- 
If thousands of users are searching the data simultaneously on a web server, then there are the chances that a very large server can be failed during that process


## Advantages of Data Structures
#### 1. Efficiency :- 
Efficiency of a program depends upon the choice of data structures. For example: suppose, we have some data and we need to perform the search for a perticular record. In that case, if we organize our data in an array, we will have to search sequentially element by element. hence, using array may not be very efficient here. There are better data structures which can make the search process efficient like ordered array, binary search tree or hash tables.

#### 2. Reusability :-
Data structures are reusable, i.e. once we have implemented a particular data structure, we can use it at any other place. Implementation of data structures can be compiled into libraries which can be used by different clients.

#### 3. Abstraction :- 
Data structure is specified by the ADT which provides a level of abstraction. The client program uses the data structure through interface only, without getting into the implementation details.
